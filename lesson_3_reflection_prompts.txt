When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	Use a remote repository when you need to collaborate or when you want others
	to be able to access your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Other users might be modifying the remote repository, and they could introduce
    code you don't want or delete code you do want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks move copies of Github repositories from one Github account to another.
	Clones move them from Github accounts to one's computer. Or from different 
	directory locations on one's comptuer.
	Branches are commit paths within a repository, either on one's computer or 
	on Github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work with this copy even if you do not have internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Github you could keep versions in a directory open to all 
	collaborators, and they could email everyone when new versions were 
	uploaded. If only one file were being modified, this might even be easier. 
	But with more than one file, and more than two collaborators, Github is 
	easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
